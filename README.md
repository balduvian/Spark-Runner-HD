# Spark-Runner-HD
Spark Runner original gamejam release was never actually uploaded to github, so here it is, rendered using LWJGL

## You'll need to link lwjgl yourself, the exact jars are in my other projects

### I'm sorry for the horridness of the code. The game was written at a dark, dark, time.

### Opengl could only save it so much
